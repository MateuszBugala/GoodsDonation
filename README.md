The GoodsDonation project is a light web-based application for people who want to donate some of their daily goods to those in need.
It works like a hub between many kind of charity institutions and individuals who would like to make a donation.

It solves a problem of: 
-	credibility of charity institutions – only verified and profiled institutions can be donees in this app; so that donors know exactly that their donation is received by those who really needs it
-	inconvenient way of physically delivering the goods to a beneficiary – the goods are picked up from the donor’s address at date and time given in the form

Some features:
- As a Donor: 
	- individual account
  - what items, are to be given
  - which charity institution will be a beneficiary – decision basing on location (city) or charity profile of the available institutions
  - exact pick up details
  - previous donations and their status
- As an Admin:
	- full control of verified institutions
	- management of the users (with “disable user” – feature)
	- control of donations and changing their status (“received”/”delivered” etc.)

Future development:
- account activation by email
- password reset by email
- data validation
- extended filtering options for institutions

Technologies used:
-	Java EE, Spring (Boot, MVC, Data, Security), Hibernate, MySQL
-	HTML/JSP,CSS,JS (some third-party)
